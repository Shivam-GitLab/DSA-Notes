/*
 * To install the JDK (Java Development Kit), you can follow these general
 * steps. Please note that specific instructions may vary depending on your
 * operating system.
 ** 
 * 1. Download the JDK:**
 * - Go to the official Oracle website or the OpenJDK website to download the
 * JDK installer.
 * - Choose the appropriate version of the JDK for your operating system
 * (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
 ** 
 * 2. Run the Installer:**
 * - Once the download is complete, run the installer by double-clicking on the
 * downloaded file.
 * - Follow the installation wizard instructions. You may need administrative
 * privileges to install the JDK on your system.
 ** 
 * 3. Specify Installation Directory:**
 * - During the installation process, you'll be asked to specify the
 * installation directory. Choose a location on your system where you want the
 * JDK to be installed.
 ** 
 * 4. Set Environment Variables (Optional, but Recommended):**
 * - After the installation is complete, you may need to set the `JAVA_HOME`
 * environment variable to point to the directory where the JDK is installed.
 * - Additionally, you may need to add the JDK's `bin` directory to the system's
 * `PATH` variable to make Java commands accessible from the command line.
 ** 
 * 5. Verify Installation:**
 * - To verify that the JDK has been installed correctly, open a terminal or
 * command prompt and type `java -version`.
 * - If Java is installed properly, you should see the version of Java installed
 * on your system.
 ** 
 * 6. Install IDE (Optional):**
 * - While not strictly necessary, many developers use Integrated Development
 * Environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for Java
 * development. You can download and install an IDE to make your Java
 * development experience more convenient.
 ** 
 * 7. Set Up Your Development Environment:**
 * - Once the JDK is installed, you're ready to start writing and running Java
 * programs. You can use a text editor or IDE to create Java source code files
 * (with a `.java` extension) and compile them using the `javac` command.
 * 
 * That's it! You've successfully installed the JDK on your system. Now you're
 * all set to start coding in Java. If you encounter any issues during the
 * installation process, refer to the documentation provided with the JDK
 * installer or seek assistance from online forums and communities.
